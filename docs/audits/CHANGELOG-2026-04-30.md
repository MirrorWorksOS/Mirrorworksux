# Changelog — 2026-04-30

Daily documentation review. Run by the `documentation` scheduled task.

## Summary

**Control-module wiring day.** The morning carried over the design-system sweep documented in yesterday's evening section (`CHANGELOG-2026-04-29.md` line 181 onward); the new work is a coordinated **8-batch sweep that closes most of the "coming soon" toast holes inside Control**. Yesterday's UX audit flagged 14 Control create/edit buttons firing dead toasts (BOMs, Machines, Inventory, Shifts, Routes, Products, Locations, Operations); today wires real dialogs/sheets to **Operations, Machines, Routes, Locations, BOMs, Groups, Shifts, Targets, Badges, Maintenance, and Tooling** — and **structurally folds two whole Control pages into modules where they belong** (Inventory → Products, Purchase → Buy Settings).

A separate **canvas-surface retone** repaints Process Builder + Factory Designer onto the MW yellow + mirage spine, dropping the residual blue/purple node fills and hand-rolled rgba dark overrides.

A small **dark-mode P1+P2 follow-up** lands in the same window: orthographic viewport panels and audit-category badges flip correctly in dark mode again.

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git log -1` | `f2a5b646` (2026-04-30 06:02 +1000) — *fix(control): close dialogs on submit success in Batch 1+2 forms* |
| Commits this run (since `0e5705e4`, the last commit covered in 04-29's evening update) | **9 commits** (35 files, +3534 / −594) |
| `git log --since="24 hours ago"` | 56 commits (overlap with 04-29 evening) |
| Working tree | **dirty** — `docs/audits/CHANGELOG-2026-04-29.md` carries the unfinished evening update from yesterday's run; not yet committed |
| Git state | **`AUTO_MERGE` ref present at `a72aac8a` with no `MERGE_HEAD`** — `git status` reports "All conflicts fixed but you are still merging" but `git diff --cached` is empty against HEAD. The conflict resolution landed cleanly in `f2a5b646`; the index appears to be a residual state. **Flagged but not auto-cleaned** — see "Working-tree state" below. |
| Stash | `stash@{0}: buy-new-order-wip — pre-main-pull stash 2026-04-22` (still unchanged, **day 9**) |

## Shipped since the 2026-04-29 evening update

The chronology starts at 22:03 +1000 on 2026-04-29 (just after the evening run authored its section) and ends at 06:02 +1000 on 2026-04-30 (HEAD).

### 1. Batch 0 — shared primitives — `e8a4461a`

The substrate the rest of today's batches consume.

- New shared component [EntityFormDialog](apps/web/src/components/shared/forms/EntityFormDialog.tsx) — generic create/edit modal with `open` / `onOpenChange` / `title` / `description` / `submitLabel` / `submitDisabled` / `onSubmit` props, a Save (yellow) + Cancel (ghost) footer, and async submit handling. Used by every Control batch dialog landed today.
- New utility [`operation-category-colors.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/operation-category-colors.ts) — 7-key palette (`Planning` / `Cutting` / `Forming` / `Machining` / `Joining` / `Finishing` / `Quality`) shared by Control → Routes step chips and Plan → Job `BomRoutingTree` op chips. Returns `{ bg, border, text, dot }` Tailwind class strings, all driven by MW design tokens (`--mw-yellow-400`, `--mw-blue-400`, `--mw-amber-400`, `--mw-info`, `--mw-mirage`, `--mw-success`, `--neutral-*`).

2 files, +203 / 0.

### 2. Batches 1 & 2 — Operations + Machines + Routes + Locations — `105f3266`, `cadd1512`

Four create/edit flows wired off `EntityFormDialog` + a side-sheet pattern.

- [`OperationFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/OperationFormDialog.tsx) — name, category, default work centre, default minutes, subcontract toggle, description. Wired to *New operation* + row click on the Operations table.
- [`MachineFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/MachineFormDialog.tsx) — name, type, location, manufacturer, model, serial, power, capacity, tolerances, maintenance interval. Wired to *Add Machine* toolbar button + the Edit action in the existing detail sheet.
- [`RouteEditorSheet`](apps/web/src/components/control/RouteEditorSheet.tsx) — full-height side sheet, not a dialog. Header with name / category / description; drag-reorderable step list with `GripVertical` handles; per-step minutes override; *Add op* picker grouped by category. Wired to *New route* + per-card Edit. Step chips now use `getCategoryColors(operation.category)` so the chip colour communicates the category.
- [`LocationFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/LocationFormDialog.tsx) — name, type, address, phone, floor area; tag-input for zones; active toggle. Wired to *New location* + clicking any location card.

> *Note on `BomRoutingTree`*: op chips there were left on their existing colour scheme — `OperationNode` has no `category` field, and the tree's chips already encode status, not category. Will be addressed if/when status colours need to merge with category colours.

6 files, +717 / −23.

### 3. Inventory merged into Products + multi-tier BOM editor — `512cd7d4`

A structural reorganisation that removes a whole Control page in favour of consolidating its actions onto Products.

**Inventory removal:**
- `/control/inventory` is now a `<Navigate to="/control/products" replace />` — old links keep working.
- Inventory removed from the sidebar.
- The three wizard components (`StocktakeWizard`, `NewAdjustmentDialog`, `NewTransferDialog`) are still defined inside [`ControlInventory.tsx`](apps/web/src/components/control/ControlInventory.tsx) and re-exported, then surfaced as toolbar buttons on the Products page.

**Products wiring:**
- *New product* → navigates to `/make/products/new` (existing form, not a dialog).
- Row click → navigates to `/make/products/:id` (existing detail).
- *Stocktake* / *Adjustment* / *Transfer* toolbar buttons open the wizards inline.

**BOMs — multi-tier editor:**
- New [`BomEditorSheet`](apps/web/src/components/control/BomEditorSheet.tsx) — full-height side sheet for create / edit with per-line `kind` selector. Four kinds: `material` (raw stock), `purchased` (off-the-shelf), `labour` (time-based), `subAssembly` (reference to another BOM by id; renders nested).
- `availableSubAssemblies` is passed in so the picker only offers existing BOMs — prevents dangling refs.
- Wired to *New BOM* + per-row Edit on the BOMs page.

6 files, +508 / −20.

### 4. Dark-mode P1+P2 follow-up — `7a65f759`

Three surfaces flipping incorrectly in dark mode are now correct. Pure additive `dark:` variants — light mode untouched (per the standing memory rule).

- **DrawingViewer** — 4-panel orthographic viewport now uses `dark:bg-card` so the white paper-space panels flip correctly.
- **PlanProductionTab** — 2D drawing container + title-block overlay both gain `dark:bg-card` / `dark:bg-card/90`.
- **ControlAudit** — all six `CATEGORY_META` badge classNames (blue / indigo / emerald / amber / slate / red) gain `dark:` counterparts, so audit badges remain legible on dark backgrounds instead of rendering as near-white chips.

3 files, +9 / −9.

### 5. Batches 4-6 — Purchase merge + Groups + Shifts + Gamification + Maintenance + Tooling — `b7ba9ae7`

The largest single commit of the run (19 files, +1509 / −392). Three batches combined:

**Batch 4 — Purchase merge + Groups dialog:**
- `ControlPurchase.tsx` (304 lines) **deleted** — its four panels (General, Approvals, Suppliers, Notifications, Reports) are now folded into `BuySettings` instead.
- `/control/purchase` is now a `<Navigate to="/buy/settings" replace />`.
- The sidebar's *Purchase* link points at `/buy/settings`.
- Off-spec role labels (`Supervisor`, `Manager`, `Director`) replaced with the canonical `team` / `lead` / `admin` set, per the access-role vocabulary memory.
- New [`GroupFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/people/GroupFormDialog.tsx) — name, description, module select. Wired to *New group*.

**Batch 5 — Shifts & Gamification:**
- [`ShiftFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/ShiftFormDialog.tsx) — employee select, day pills, time range, shift type, work centre. Wired to *New shift* + cell click on a filled cell to edit.
- [`TargetFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/TargetFormDialog.tsx) — name, metric, period, value, active/draft switch. Wired to *Add target* + per-row edit.
- [`BadgeFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/BadgeFormDialog.tsx) — name, description, icon select (14 icons), criteria textarea, live icon preview. Wired to *Create badge* + per-badge edit.

**Batch 6 — Maintenance & Tooling:**
- [`MaintenanceFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/MaintenanceFormDialog.tsx) — machine, type, description, date, assignedTo, est. cost. Wired to a new *Schedule maintenance* button + row click for edit.
- New `linkedMachineId` / `linkedMachineName` on the `ToolingItem` interface (entities.ts).
- New [`toolingLibrary.ts`](apps/web/src/services/toolingLibrary.ts) service — **19 templates across 5 categories**: Cutting (5: end mill, drill, tap, reamer, insert), Forming, Welding, Measuring, Workholding. Each template has a `defaultProps` map (number / text / select with options + defaults) so the dialog can pre-fill.
- [`ToolingFormDialog`](apps/web/src/components/control/ToolingFormDialog.tsx) — toolId, template (grouped select by category), type, description, location, **linked machine**, expected life, dates. Wired to a new *Add tool* button.
- The Tooling table gains a *Linked Machine* column.

> The commit body notes pre-existing typecheck errors in `vite.config.ts`, several test files, and `admin` / `bridge` / `book` components — *not caused by these changes*. Worth flagging for the next typecheck cleanup pass.

19 files, +1509 / −392.

### 6. Out-of-scope state refs + missing React import — `554a651c`

Tiny but blocking-grade fix.

- `targetColumns` in `ControlGamification` was referencing `editingTarget` / `setEditingTarget` state defined inside the component body — `targetColumns` is declared at module scope, so those refs were undefined at render time.
- `BadgeFormDialog` was missing its `import React from 'react'`.

2 files, +7 / −4.

### 7. Process Builder + Factory Designer retone — `2abcfd85` then `695a9499`

> Two commits with identical messages and identical 4-file footprints (`+352 / −157` each). The diff `2abcfd85..695a9499` is non-empty (`31 files, +1489 / −2184`), suggesting the retone was applied, partially reverted by intervening work, and then re-applied — or that one was a cherry-pick of the other. Worth checking whether one should be dropped before the next force-friendly history operation; both are presently on `main`.

Unifies the canvas surfaces around the brand spine — yellow stays the only chromatic accent, everything structural (people, resources, custom blocks, machine cards, station markers) lives on a new mirage tonal scale. Specific changes:

- Drops blue and purple from node fills.
- Removes hand-rolled `rgba()` dark-mode overrides (replaced by token-driven dark variants).
- Normalises canvas typography onto the M3 `label-medium` / `label-small` tokens.
- Selection swaps to a yellow halo via a new `pb-selection-glow` filter + a solid 1.5 px ring.
- Dragged nodes lift to `elevation-3` with `0.85` opacity.
- Library/palette items rebuilt on the 8 / 12 / 16 spacing grid with hover-lift and active-scale feedback.

Touched: [`ControlFactoryDesigner.tsx`](apps/web/src/components/control/ControlFactoryDesigner.tsx), [`ControlProcessBuilder.tsx`](apps/web/src/components/control/ControlProcessBuilder.tsx), [`design-system.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/design-system.ts) (+18 lines of new tokens), [`globals.css`](apps/web/src/styles/globals.css) (+83 / −18 — the new filter, scale, and a few mirage-tonal vars).

### 8. Close dialogs on submit success — `f2a5b646`

A fix to reconcile the Batch 1 + 2 dialogs (Operation / Machine / Location) with `main`'s `EntityFormDialog` API. The standalone `EntityFormDialog` does not auto-close on submit; the dialogs were authored against a slightly different draft that did. Fix:

- Each `onSubmit` handler now calls `onOpenChange(false)` explicitly when the entity validates.
- Validation `return false` early-exits became plain `return` because the simpler API ignores return values.

2 files, +4 / −2.

## Working-tree state

`git status` reports the merge as in-progress, but the only actual diff against `HEAD` is the unfinished evening update on yesterday's changelog:

```
M docs/audits/CHANGELOG-2026-04-29.md   (+182 lines, evening update never committed)
```

Index appears confused: `git status` lists 15 staged paths including `Sidebar.tsx`, several `Control*.tsx`, the new `Batch 0/1/2` dialogs, the new `EntityFormDialog`, and `routes.tsx` — but `git diff --cached` is empty. All of those paths landed cleanly in commits `e8a4461a`, `105f3266`, `cadd1512`, `512cd7d4`, `b7ba9ae7`, and `f2a5b646`. The `.git/AUTO_MERGE` ref pointing at `a72aac8a` is the only artefact left of the prior merge.

**Suggested resolution** (deferred to interactive session): after committing the working-tree changelog edit, run `git merge --abort` (no-op since no conflicts remain) or simply remove `.git/AUTO_MERGE` after confirming no merge is in flight.

## Headline numbers

| Surface | Count |
|---|---|
| New Control create/edit dialogs / sheets | **11** — `EntityFormDialog`, `OperationFormDialog`, `MachineFormDialog`, `LocationFormDialog`, `RouteEditorSheet`, `BomEditorSheet`, `GroupFormDialog`, `ShiftFormDialog`, `TargetFormDialog`, `BadgeFormDialog`, `MaintenanceFormDialog`, `ToolingFormDialog` (12 if you count `EntityFormDialog`) |
| Coming-soon toasts cleared | 11 buttons + N row-click handlers across Operations / Machines / Routes / Locations / BOMs / Groups / Shifts / Targets / Badges / Maintenance / Tooling |
| Whole pages folded away | 2 — `ControlPurchase` (→ Buy Settings), `ControlInventory` (→ Products; wizard components retained) |
| New shared utilities | `operation-category-colors.ts` (7-key palette), `toolingLibrary.ts` (19 templates × 5 categories) |
| New entity fields | `ToolingItem.linkedMachineId`, `ToolingItem.linkedMachineName` |
| Files in net Control diff (since 04-29 evening) | 35 changed, +3534 / −594 lines |
| Canvas surfaces retoned | 2 (Process Builder, Factory Designer) — yellow + mirage only, blue/purple dropped |
| Dark-mode regressions fixed | 3 (`DrawingViewer`, `PlanProductionTab`, `ControlAudit` badges) |

## Documentation gaps surfaced today

### Stale docs from page consolidations

Two existing dev/user docs now describe pages that have become redirects:

| Doc | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| [`docs/dev/modules/control/inventory.md`](docs/dev/modules/control/inventory.md) + user equivalent | `/control/inventory` | redirect → `/control/products` |
| [`docs/dev/modules/control/purchase.md`](docs/dev/modules/control/purchase.md) + user equivalent | `/control/purchase` | redirect → `/buy/settings` |

Both should either be (a) updated to describe the redirect + the new home of the actions, or (b) deleted with a redirect note in the module README. The `inventory` case is more nuanced — the wizards (`StocktakeWizard`, `NewAdjustmentDialog`, `NewTransferDialog`) still live in `ControlInventory.tsx` and are imported by `ControlProducts`; that consolidation should be documented somewhere.

[`docs/user/modules/control/README.md`](docs/user/modules/control/README.md) likewise still lists *Inventory* and *Purchase Control* as Main Routes/Pages (lines 21, 22), and references both `ControlPurchase.tsx` (now deleted) and `ControlInventory.tsx` under Important Components (lines 47, 48). The Main Routes/Pages list also remains missing entries for **Operations** (`/control/operations`), **Routes** (`/control/routes`), **Audit** (`/control/audit`), **Billing** (`/control/billing`), and **Groups** (`/control/groups`) — those gaps date to before today but are now sharper because the dialogs they describe are real.

### Newly-wired surfaces with thin docs

Each of these has a stub or empty section in its existing module doc; today's wiring substantially changes the workflow, so the doc should be brought up:

- **Operations** — there is no `docs/dev/modules/control/operations.md` or `docs/user/...` (carry-over from prior changelogs).
- **Routes** — same as Operations.
- **BOMs** — `docs/dev/modules/control/boms.md` exists but predates the multi-tier editor + sub-assembly references. The `BomEditorSheet` flow and the `kind: 'subAssembly'` line type are undocumented.
- **Maintenance / Tooling / Shifts / Gamification / People (Groups)** — each has an existing doc but neither describes the new create/edit dialogs that landed today.

### Tooling library

[`apps/web/src/services/toolingLibrary.ts`](apps/web/src/services/toolingLibrary.ts) ships 19 templates across 5 categories, with per-template `defaultProps`. Worth a brief reference doc (e.g. `docs/dev/modules/control/tooling.md` *Standard tool templates* section) so a future contributor can find / extend the catalogue.

### `operation-category-colors`

7-key palette in [`apps/web/src/lib/operation-category-colors.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/operation-category-colors.ts) is now consumed by Control → Routes step chips and (eventually) Plan → BOM routing. Worth a one-line entry in `docs/dev/shared/` so the next person adding a route chip doesn't roll a fresh palette.

### Carry-over from yesterday's evening section

All five "evening additions" suggested follow-ups (in CHANGELOG-2026-04-29.md lines 350-355) remain open, plus all eight morning-section follow-ups (lines 162-173). No additional gaps closed in this run beyond what's listed above.

## Suggested follow-ups for an interactive session

In rough priority order:

1. **Commit the working-tree edit to `CHANGELOG-2026-04-29.md`** — it's a substantial 182-line authoring artefact for yesterday's design-system sweep; should not be left dangling.
2. **Resolve the residual merge state** — `git merge --abort` (or remove `.git/AUTO_MERGE`) once the changelog edit is committed, so `git status` is clean again.
3. **Author `docs/dev/modules/control/operations.md` + `routes.md` + user equivalents** — both pages now have full create/edit flows; the 2026-04-23 carry-over is now blocking actually-new functionality.
4. **Refresh `docs/dev/modules/control/boms.md` + user equivalent** for the multi-tier `BomEditorSheet` (`kind` line types, `subAssembly` references, `availableSubAssemblies` propagation).
5. **Update `docs/user/modules/control/README.md`** — drop *Inventory* and *Purchase Control* from Main Routes/Pages (or note them as redirects); drop `ControlPurchase.tsx` from Important Components; add Operations / Routes / Audit / Billing / Groups.
6. **Decide the fate of `inventory.md` + `purchase.md` docs** — update to describe the redirect or delete them outright.
7. **Capture screenshots** for the four newly-wired flows: Operations dialog, Machines dialog, Routes editor sheet, BOM editor sheet. Drop into `docs/audits/screenshots/control/`.
8. **Author `docs/dev/shared/operation-category-colors.md`** + reference the palette from any module that grows op chips.
9. **Investigate the duplicate retone commits** (`2abcfd85`, `695a9499`) — same message, identical 4-file footprint, but the inter-commit diff is 31 files; one or the other may be redundant on `main`.
10. **Triage / clear the stash** — `stash@{0}: buy-new-order-wip` is now **9 days** old and almost certainly obsolete after `fb992c26` shipped Buy create flows on 2026-04-28.
11. **Carry-over from 2026-04-29 evening** — items 1-5 in that section's "Suggested follow-ups (evening additions)" remain open; all eight morning-section follow-ups likewise.

## Output

This file. Authoring the new dev/user docs is deferred to an interactive session, in keeping with the precedent set in every prior daily run since 2026-04-26 (rationale: the gap docs benefit from author judgement on tone, screenshot capture, and contract-level accuracy that's hard to get right inside an autonomous run). The shipping artefacts for today are the **9 commits** documented above (the +3534 lines of Control wiring + retone) — those are self-documenting in their commit bodies and the inline doc-comments on the new components.
