## Components Used
- `@/components/shared/layout/JobWorkspaceLayout`
- `@/components/ui/badge`
- `@/components/ui/button`
- `@/components/ui/card`
- `@/components/ui/input`
- `@/components/ui/label`
- `@/components/ui/table`
- `@/components/ui/tooltip`
- `@/components/ui/utils`

## Logic / Behaviour
- Routing links and back navigation are handled in-component.
- Behavior is largely client-side React state and memoized derivations.

## Dependencies
- No explicit store/service/hook dependency imported in this component.

## Known Gaps / Questions
- Code includes explicit placeholder/legacy markers; some interactions are transitional.
- Page appears mock/seed-backed; production API integration path is unclear from this file alone.
- Multiple actions resolve to toast feedback, which may indicate incomplete mutation wiring.
- Dynamic route exists but robust data loading/error recovery is not obvious in this component.
