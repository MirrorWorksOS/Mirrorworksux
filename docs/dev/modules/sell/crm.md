## Components Used
- `@/components/shared/data/StatusBadge`
- `@/components/shared/feedback/EmptyState`
- `@/components/shared/layout/IconViewToggle`
- `@/components/shared/layout/PageHeader`
- `@/components/shared/layout/PageShell`
- `@/components/shared/layout/PageToolbar`
- `@/components/shared/layout/ToolbarFilterButton`
- `@/components/shared/layout/ToolbarPrimaryButton`

- `@/components/shared/surfaces/SpotlightCard`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`

## Logic / Behaviour
- Local state drives search/filter and derived visible lists.
- Routing links and back navigation are handled in-component.
- Behavior is largely client-side React state and memoized derivations.

## Dependencies
- No explicit store/service/hook dependency imported in this component.

## Known Gaps / Questions
- Code includes explicit placeholder/legacy markers; some interactions are transitional.
- Page appears mock/seed-backed; production API integration path is unclear from this file alone.
- Multiple actions resolve to toast feedback, which may indicate incomplete mutation wiring.

## Related Files
