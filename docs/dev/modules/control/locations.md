# Developer stub — control/locations.md

<!-- TODO: migrate developer-only content from docs/user/modules/control/locations.md here. -->

This file is a placeholder created during the 2026-04-18 Control module migration. The
source document at `docs/user/modules/control/locations.md` is a Mixed-classification doc (user
intent + component/dependency references in one file). It has not been split yet.

## Sections to migrate

- Components Used (component import list)
- Logic / Behaviour (state model, derivations)
- Dependencies (stores, services, hooks)
- Design / UX Notes (dev-relevant caveats only)
- Known Gaps / Questions (dev-facing)
- Related Files

User-facing sections (Summary, User Intent, Primary Actions, Key UI Sections, Data Shown,
States) remain in `docs/user/modules/control/locations.md` until a human editor does the split.

## Components Used
- `@/components/shared/icons/IconWell`
- `@/components/shared/layout/PageHeader`
- `@/components/shared/layout/PageShell`
- `@/components/shared/motion/motion-variants`
- `@/components/shared/surfaces/SpotlightCard`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/badge.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/input.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/utils.tsx`

## Logic / Behaviour
- Local state drives search/filter and derived visible lists.
- Behavior is largely client-side React state and memoized derivations.

## Dependencies
- No explicit store/service/hook dependency imported in this component.

## Known Gaps / Questions
- Code includes explicit placeholder/legacy markers; some interactions are transitional.
- Multiple actions resolve to toast feedback, which may indicate incomplete mutation wiring.
