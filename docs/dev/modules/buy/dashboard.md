<!-- TODO: Dev stub pending content migration from docs/user/modules/buy/dashboard.md.
     The source file is Mixed (user + developer content). A human editor needs
     to split the dev-facing sections out to this file. Do not hand-copy blindly
     — the audit at docs/audits/dev/AUDIT-buy.md lists accuracy issues (e.g. the
     "No explicit store/service/hook dependency" line is factually wrong for
     nearly every Buy screen). Correct as you split. -->
