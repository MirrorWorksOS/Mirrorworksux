## Logic / Behaviour
- Local state drives search/filter and derived visible lists.
- Behavior is largely client-side React state and memoized derivations.

## Dependencies
- No explicit store/service/hook dependency imported in this component.

## Design / UX Notes
- No explicit mock marker in this file; verify real-data behavior in integration testing.
- Placeholder/legacy text suggests unfinished UX in parts of this page.
- Some CTAs provide confirmation toasts without obvious persistence in-file.

## Known Gaps / Questions
- Code includes explicit placeholder/legacy markers; some interactions are transitional.
- Multiple actions resolve to toast feedback, which may indicate incomplete mutation wiring.
